116088,15_05_2022_18_32,@AmazonHelp I’ve cancelled my order and gone to Best Buy. Thank you.

sprintcare,15_05_2022_18_32,@116171 Good afternoon. This is distressing. Send me a DM so I can see what happened.
116171,15_05_2022_18_32,"@115714 customer service 👎! 4 different people said they have no idea how to help, the two people who actually have tried did it wrong 😡"
sprintcare,15_05_2022_18_32,"@116172 Hey :)! Let's look into this, DM us. -CS"
116172,15_05_2022_18_32,@sprintcare I called customer care when I tweeted this and they said double charge would be credited. Still no credit.
116172,15_05_2022_18_32,@115714 chk ur latest bill. I paid for note 8 shipping w/debit when ordered. Latest bill shows ship charge. This happened to other friends.
sprintcare,15_05_2022_18_32,@116173 Hey Tiffany! I'd like to work with you on your issues. Can you shoot us a DM for us to have a little chat? -ResolutionSup DC
